# Leaf Classification Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Leaf Classification Project! This initiative is focused on the classification of leaves using feature vectors and employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). In the pursuit of achieving optimal results, we have meticulously designed and implemented a CNN architecture. Our methodology incorporates best practices in choosing initial weights, addressing regularization concerns, and implementing measures to prevent overfitting. Additionally, hyperparameters, including optimizers, have been fine-tuned to ensure the best possible results.

## Project Structure

- **data_analysis**: Exploratory data analysis was conducted to understand the dataset's characteristics and inform preprocessing decisions.

- **model_training**: CNN model design, hyperparameter tuning, and training. The training process involves monitoring validation loss and selecting the best weights for the model.

- **preprocessing**: Data preprocessing is a crucial step to ensure that the input data is suitable for the model.
